      <h1>about me</h1>

      <p>As a bioinformatics and computer science student, I hope to gain skills and hands-on experience in both medicine and technology. I would also like to gain experience and exposure to user experience design and product management. Ultimately, I plan on working in the intersection of biomedicine and data science to improve patient outcomes with extensive and well-communicated information.</p>

      <p>Outside of programming and academics, I take care of my furballs Terry and Roshi. I also enjoy watching dramatic TV shows, playing survival games, bullet journalling. </p>
